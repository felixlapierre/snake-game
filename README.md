# snake-game

The classic arcade game Snake, created in Java by Felix Lapierre.
2018

This game was made using Java's Applet library. As far as I know, the only way to run it is to open the project in NetBeans, select the GameTest.java class, and press shift+F6.

The GameTest.java class also has a bunch of variables and constants that you can mess with to change the amount of snakes, make the snakes infinitely long, toggle looping map edges, and a few others.
